# WHO Survey - Cancer Rates Between 1990-2008 (Tableau) Dashboard & Analysis

The goal of this project was to design an **intuitive dashboard** showcasing key insights from WHO (World Health Organisation) Survery cancer rate data (1990–2008).

**Cancer affects 1 in 2 people throughout our lifetime**. Tracking trends in cancer rates and supporting data across the globe helps our understanding of cancer incidence, mortality, survival, risk, and diagnosis and treatment.

<h2 id="methodology / approach">Methodology / Approach</h2>

<li>In Tableau, I created separate sheets for each visualisation and combined them into a cohesive dashboard. Calculated fields were used to determine global cancer incidence rates with the formula: Incidence Rate = (Number of new cases) / (Total population) * 100. This approach ensures accurate and insightful analysis of the data.</li>
<li>Visualisation: The dashboard features a heatmap, table, pie chart, column, and bar charts to showcase global cancer rates. These visuals highlight trends over time and patterns in risk factors, making key insights easy to interpret.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Design: Built with an intuitive interface for seamless navigation and accessibility.</li>
<li>Customisable: Fully adaptable, allowing users to modify charts and tables to accommodate evolving data and analysis needs.</li>

<h2 id="key findings">Key Findings</h2>

<li>Cancer rates are highest in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with a clear upward trend in global rates over time. Men experience significantly higher incidences of stomach, lung, and liver cancers compared to women.</li>
<li>Interestingly, for liver, lung, and stomach cancers, high BMI and blood pressure seem to have little correlation with case numbers. However, high cholesterol shows a notable association with increased cases, making it a potential risk factor to investigate further.</li>
<li>Regional analysis reveals that Asia leads in liver cancer rates, likely due to higher prevalence of hepatitis and dietary factors, while Europe and the Americas report higher lung cancer rates, influenced by smoking habits.</li>
<li>Additionally, stomach cancer is more common in regions where certain dietary infections are prevalent, such as East Asia.</li>
<li>These findings underline the importance of tailored public health strategies to address regional variations and key risk factors, while continuing to explore preventive measures for high-risk groups.</li>

<h2 id="conclusions & insights">Conclusions & Insights</h2>

<li>National Health Systems must view the rise in global cancer rates as a critical call to action, galvanising efforts to strengthen cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and support frameworks. A multi-faceted approach is essential to combat this growing challenge effectively.</li>
<li>Public health education should take centre stage, particularly targeting high-risk groups through tailored campaigns. Educating individuals about the links between lifestyle factors—such as smoking, poor diet, sedentary behaviour, and alcohol consumption—and cancer can empower communities to make healthier choices. Early intervention programs that promote awareness of symptoms and encourage routine health check-ups can significantly increase the chances of detecting cancer in its early stages, when treatment is most effective.</li>
<li>Expanding and improving screening programs is another key component. For example, accessible screening for common cancers, such as breast, cervical, and colorectal, can lead to earlier diagnoses and better outcomes. Introducing or enhancing national screening protocols for lung and liver cancers in high-risk populations, such as smokers could further reduce mortality rates.</li>
<li>Investments in cancer research hold the potential to revolutionise care. Advancements in genomic medicine, for instance, enable personalised treatment plans tailored to an individual’s genetic makeup, improving efficacy and reducing side effects. Research into risk factors, prevention methods, and cutting-edge therapies, like immunotherapy or targeted treatments, can help minimise the impact of rising cancer rates over time.</li>
<li>Addressing socio-economic and regional disparities in cancer care is vital. Many low-income countries face challenges like limited access to healthcare facilities, expensive treatments, and shortages of trained professionals. National Health Systems can work collaboratively to provide funding, resources, and training programs to ensure equitable access to life-saving interventions.</li>
<li>Ultimately, prioritising a comprehensive, well-funded approach that combines prevention, education, early detection, equitable care, and research can help mitigate the global burden of cancer. Such strategies not only save lives but also improve the quality of life for patients and their families. By taking decisive action now, we can create a future where the rising tide of cancer rates is met with resilience and hope.</li>

<h2 id="challenges & limitations">Challenges & Limitations</h2>

<li>Cancer rates are particularly high in Asia, Europe, and the Americas; however, this may partly reflect disparities in data collection, with some continents lacking reliable cancer statistics. Improving data reliability in underrepresented regions could reveal hidden trends and provide a more accurate global picture.</li>
<li>Environmental factors like air pollution and exposure to carcinogens are critical areas to investigate, as they likely contribute to the rising cancer rates. Regions with industrial activity, urbanisation, and weak regulations for environmental protection may experience heightened risks. Examining these factors can not only enhance understanding but also inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies.</li>
